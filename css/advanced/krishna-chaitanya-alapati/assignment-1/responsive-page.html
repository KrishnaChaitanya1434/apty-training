          <h3>Short Story for kids</h3>
          <p>
            A small story could be about a little bird who learns to fly.
            Initially scared and hesitant, the bird watches its parents soar
            through the sky. After some encouragement, the bird takes a leap of
            faith, flapping its wings and experiencing the joy of flight. It
            discovers the freedom and beauty of the world from above, realizing
            that even small creatures can achieve great things with courage and
            practice.

          <h3>Tiny Sci-fi Story for kids</h3>
          <p>
            Lila found a tiny spaceship in her backyard—no bigger than a
            ladybug! Inside sat a glowing alien named Pik. "Help!" it squeaked.
            "I need one AAA battery to get home!" Lila ran inside, grabbed a
            battery, and watched Pik zoom back to the stars.

            you're gone, Off to your planet's dawn!"
